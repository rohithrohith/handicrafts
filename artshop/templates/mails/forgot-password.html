    <h1>Hi, Greetings</h1>
    <p>You are just a step away from accessing your account</p>
    <p>We are sharing a verification code to access your account. The code is valid for 10 minutes and usable only once.
    </p>
    <p>Once you have verified the code, you'll be prompted to set a new password immediately. This is to ensure that
        only
        you have access to your account.</p><br>
